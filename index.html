      <p>Sanjiv's first interaction with Shelly happened at MIT College of Engineering, Pune, where he completed his Bachelor's in Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering. Sanjiv started messaging her during December 2023, and ended up raping Shelly on the night of 20th January 2024. Post his activity, he rigorously attempted to escape to the USA. He mentions that the visa interview in itself is the greatest sham. It is relatively easy to lie during the interview process and the visa officers approve or reject the visa based on how well one can lie during the interview. He mentions that
          While the US Embassy is yet to be notified of this applicant, Sanjiv seems to have a casual attitude towards the visa interview process in general.

      <p>The details of the case help us understand how Indian criminals are in violation of the overall immigration process and choose to take it lightly.
      The authorities are yet to be notified of these endeavors.</p>
